# raylib-3D
An extension library for the amazing raylib library, that adds better support for 3D. The Deffered Rendering is based on the work done by @TheLumaio, but moved to a single header format with functions and data structures renamed to better follow the raylib code style.

Current Implementation Plan:
- [ ] Deffered Rendering
- [ ] Model, Material, Animation loading through Assimp
- [ ] Skeletal Animation playback

Wherever possible, this extension library will follow the raylib paradigm in both naming convention and ease of use. Users should be able to include this with raylib, and have interoperability. 

**Special Thanks:**
- The Lumaio, [for work on GBuffer implementation using raylib](https://github.com/TheLumaio/Raylib-GBuffers)
- Raysan, for the creation of raylib!
