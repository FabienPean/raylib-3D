# raylib-3D
An extension library for the amazing raylib library, that adds better support for 3D.

Current Implementation Plan:
- [ ] Deffered Rendering
- [ ] Model, Material, Animation loading through Assimp
- [ ] Skeletal Animation playback

Wherever possible, this extension library will follow the raylib paradigm in both naming convention and ease of use. Users should be able to include this with raylib, and have interoperability. 

**Special Thanks:**
- The Lumaio, [for work on intial GBuffer implementation using raylib](https://github.com/TheLumaio/Raylib-GBuffers)
- Raysan, for the creation of raylib!
